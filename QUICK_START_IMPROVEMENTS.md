## 💡 Recommendations

### Option 1: Continue With All Features
I can continue implementing all 17 features systematically. This will take considerable time but will deliver the complete storyboard vision.

### Option 2: Focus on Priority Features
Focus on the most critical 5-6 features that provide maximum user value:
1. Owner Dashboard
2. Rental Requests (critical for operations)
3. Enhanced Bike Details
4. Rental History
5. Verification badges

### Option 3: Staged Approach
- **Phase 1 (Completed):** Landing page + security ✅
- **Phase 2 (Next):** Owner features (dashboard, requests, verification)
- **Phase 3 (Later):** Renter enhancements (map, history, profile)
- **Phase 4 (Final):** Admin tools (management, reports)
