# üìß Email Verification Setup Guide

## Complete Step-by-Step Guide to Enable Gmail Email Verification

This guide will walk you through setting up Gmail SMTP for sending verification emails in your Bike Ta Bai application.

---

## üéØ Overview

The email verification system:
1. ‚úÖ Sends verification email when user registers
2. ‚úÖ User clicks link in email to verify
3. ‚úÖ Account is activated after verification
4. ‚úÖ User can then login
5. ‚úÖ Sends welcome email after verification

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Gmail account (or Google Workspace account)
- Access to Google Account settings

---

## üîß Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification on Your Gmail

**Why:** Google requires 2-step verification to generate App Passwords for security.

### Instructions:

1. **Go to Google Account Security**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Or: Click your profile picture ‚Üí "Manage your Google Account" ‚Üí "Security"

2. **Enable 2-Step Verification**
   - Scroll to "How you sign in to Google"
   - Click on "2-Step Verification"
   - Click "GET STARTED"
   - Follow the prompts to set up with your phone number
   - Complete the setup process

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You should now have 2-Step Verification enabled.

---

## üîë Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password

**Why:** App Passwords allow applications to access your Gmail without using your main password.

### Instructions:

1. **Access App Passwords Page**
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Or: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords (at the bottom)

2. **Create New App Password**
   - You may need to re-enter your Google password
   - Under "Select app", choose "Mail" or "Other (Custom name)"
   - If you choose "Other", type: `Bike Ta Bai` or `ASP.NET App`
   - Under "Select device", choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Type: `BiketaBai Server` or `Development Machine`
   - Click "GENERATE"

3. **Copy the Generated Password**
   - Google will show you a 16-character password (with spaces)
   - Example: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy this password immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
   - Keep it safe and secure

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You now have a 16-character App Password.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Your Application

### Update `appsettings.json`

1. Open `/Users/macbookpro/Documents/BiketaBai3.0/appsettings.json`

2. Find the `EmailSettings` section:

```json
"EmailSettings": {
  "SenderName": "Bike Ta Bai",
  "SenderEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SmtpPort": "587",
  "SmtpPassword": "your-app-password-here"
}
```

3. **Replace the values:**
   - `SenderEmail`: Your Gmail address (e.g., `john.doe@gmail.com`)
   - `SmtpPassword`: The 16-character App Password you generated
     - **Remove all spaces** from the password
     - Example: Change `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` to `abcdefghijklmnop`

### Example Configuration:

```json
"EmailSettings": {
  "SenderName": "Bike Ta Bai",
  "SenderEmail": "johndoe@gmail.com",
  "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SmtpPort": "587",
  "SmtpPassword": "abcdefghijklmnop"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** Never commit your App Password to Git! Use environment variables in production.

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 4: Update Database Schema

Since we added new fields to the User model, we need to update the database:

### Run Migration Commands:

```bash
cd /Users/macbookpro/Documents/BiketaBai3.0

# Create a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add AddEmailVerificationFields

# Apply the migration
dotnet ef database update
```

This will add these new columns to the `users` table:
- `email_verification_token` (VARCHAR(100))
- `email_verification_token_expires` (DATETIME)

---

## üß™ Step 5: Test the Email Verification

### 1. Install Required Package (if not done)

```bash
cd /Users/macbookpro/Documents/BiketaBai3.0
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 3. Test Registration

1. Open browser: http://localhost:5000/Account/Register
2. Fill in the registration form:
   - Use a **real email** you have access to
   - Complete all fields
   - Select Renter and/or Owner
3. Click "Create Account"

### 4. Check Your Email

1. Check your inbox (and spam folder!)
2. Look for email from "Bike Ta Bai"
3. Subject: "Verify Your Email - Bike Ta Bai"
4. Click the "Verify Email Address" button

### 5. Verify Your Account

- You'll be redirected to the verification page
- Should see "Email Verified!" message
- Click "Login to Your Account"

### 6. Login

- Enter your email and password
- You should be able to login successfully!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Unable to connect to SMTP server"

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify `SmtpServer` is `smtp.gmail.com`
- Verify `SmtpPort` is `587`
- Make sure you're not behind a firewall blocking port 587

### Issue 2: "Authentication failed"

**Solutions:**
- Double-check your Gmail address is correct
- Verify App Password is correct (no spaces!)
- Confirm 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Try generating a new App Password
- Make sure you're using the App Password, NOT your regular Gmail password

### Issue 3: "Email not received"

**Solutions:**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Wait a few minutes (email delivery can be delayed)
- Check application logs for errors: `logs/biketabai-*.txt`
- Verify the recipient email is correct
- Test sending to a different email address

### Issue 4: "Table 'users' doesn't have column 'email_verification_token'"

**Solution:**
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddEmailVerificationFields
dotnet ef database update
```

### Issue 5: "Failed to send verification email" on registration

**Check:**
1. Application logs in `logs/` directory
2. Email settings in `appsettings.json`
3. App Password is correctly configured
4. Try the "Test Email" command below

## üì¨ Testing Email Sending

To test if email is working without registering, you can create a test endpoint:

Create `/Pages/TestEmail.cshtml.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using BiketaBai.Services;

namespace BiketaBai.Pages;

public class TestEmailModel : PageModel
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public TestEmailModel(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public string? Message { get; set; }

    public async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync(string? email)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
        {
            Message = "Please provide email: /TestEmail?email=yourmail@gmail.com";
            return Page();
        }

        try
        {
            await _emailService.SendVerificationEmailAsync(
                email, 
                "Test User", 
                "http://localhost:5000/Account/VerifyEmail?token=test&email=test@test.com"
            );
            Message = $"Test email sent successfully to {email}!";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Message = $"Error: {ex.Message}";
        }

        return Page();
    }
}
```

Create `/Pages/TestEmail.cshtml`:

```html
@page
@model TestEmailModel
<div class="container">
    <h1>Test Email</h1>
    <p>@Model.Message</p>
</div>
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:5000/TestEmail?email=your-email@gmail.com`

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Development:
1. ‚úÖ Use App Passwords (never your main Gmail password)
2. ‚úÖ Add `appsettings.json` to `.gitignore`
3. ‚úÖ Don't commit sensitive credentials

### For Production:
1. ‚úÖ Use environment variables for credentials
2. ‚úÖ Consider using services like SendGrid, AWS SES, or Mailgun
3. ‚úÖ Enable HTTPS only
4. ‚úÖ Rate limit email sending to prevent abuse
5. ‚úÖ Implement email sending queue for reliability

### Update Program.cs for Production:

```csharp
// Read from environment variables in production
if (!builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    var emailSettings = builder.Configuration.GetSection("EmailSettings");
    emailSettings["SenderEmail"] = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EMAIL_SENDER") ?? emailSettings["SenderEmail"];
    emailSettings["SmtpPassword"] = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EMAIL_PASSWORD") ?? emailSettings["SmtpPassword"];
}
```
