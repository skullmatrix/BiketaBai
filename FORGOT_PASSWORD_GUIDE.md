# üîê Forgot Password Feature - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ Feature Overview

The **Forgot Password** feature allows users who have forgotten their password to securely reset it by receiving a password reset link via email. This feature integrates seamlessly with your existing email verification system.

---

## üéØ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User clicks "Forgot password?" on Login page**
2. **User enters their email address**
3. **System generates secure reset token (valid for 1 hour)**
4. **System sends password reset email with link**
5. **User clicks link in email**
6. **User enters new password**
7. **Password is updated**
8. **User receives confirmation email**
9. **User can login with new password**

## üîß What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `password_reset_token` column to `users` table
- Added `password_reset_token_expires` column to `users` table

### 2. Email Service Updates
- **`SendPasswordResetEmailAsync()`** - Sends password reset link
- **`SendPasswordChangedNotificationAsync()`** - Confirms password was changed

### 3. New Pages Created

#### **ForgotPassword Page** (`/Account/ForgotPassword`)
- User enters their email
- Generates reset token
- Sends email with reset link
- Uses security best practice: Always shows success message even if email doesn't exist (prevents email enumeration attacks)

#### **ResetPassword Page** (`/Account/ResetPassword`)
- Validates reset token and expiration
- User enters new password
- Updates password in database
- Clears reset token
- Sends confirmation email

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Not Receiving Reset Email

**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email settings in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   "EmailSettings": {
     "SenderEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
     "SmtpPassword": "your-app-password-here"
   }
   ```
3. Check application logs in `logs/` folder
4. Verify Gmail App Password is correct
5. Test email service with a simple test

**Test Email Service:**
```csharp
// Add this to a test page or controller
await _emailService.SendPasswordResetEmailAsync(
    "your-test-email@gmail.com",
    "Test User",
    "http://test.com/reset"
);
```

### Problem: "Invalid or Expired Link" Error

**Solutions:**
1. Check if link was used more than 1 hour ago
2. Request a new password reset link
3. Make sure you're using the complete link from email
4. Check if password was already reset (tokens are one-time use)

### Problem: Weak Password Error

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure password is at least 8 characters
2. Include at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
3. Include at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
4. Include at least one number (0-9)

**Valid Examples:**
- `Password123`
- `MySecure2024`
- `BikeRental99`

**Invalid Examples:**
- `password` (no uppercase, no number)
- `PASSWORD123` (no lowercase)
- `Pass123` (too short)
