Implementation/Deployment Phase,"In the Implementation/Deployment Phase, the Bike Ta Bai system becomes fully active for renters, bike owners, and administrators. Renters browse and book bicycles directly through the web application on their devices, while owners manage bike listings, approve rental requests, and monitor active rentals through the owner dashboard. Administrators manage and monitor the entire platform from the admin dashboard, including user verification, system oversight, and analytics. All users receive real-time notifications for booking confirmations, payment alerts, and geofence violations, keeping everyone informed quickly and clearly. The system operates seamlessly across desktop and mobile browsers, ensuring accessibility for all users regardless of their device."

It explains how renters can browse available bikes, create bookings, and manage their rentals through the web application. For owners, it details how to list bikes, manage rental requests, track earnings, and monitor renter locations during active rentals. For administrators, it covers user management, owner verification, system monitoring, and reporting features.
